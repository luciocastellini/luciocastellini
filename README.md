Heyyy! 👋

I'm a high school student from sunny Arizona, and this is my current GitHub account! 🌵  
I'm passionate about computer science and hoping to study at Purdue University or ASU.  
Web development is my jam—I love working with React, Vite, TypeScript, and all sorts of cool technologies. 💻

Besides coding, I’m really into food (especially baking 🥐), hiking 🥾, and flying as a student pilot ✈️.  
Whether I'm building web apps, whipping up something tasty, or soaring through the skies, I'm always excited to learn and explore.

Feel free to connect or check out my projects! 🚀
