# Heyyy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Lucio**. My world is a mix of tech and fresh airâ€”I spend a lot of time coding and building things, but I've gotta have my balance. When I step away from the keyboard, I'm usually outside for a hike, or maybe indoors baking up a storm. Seriously, any chance to be outdoors is a win in my book, especially if I can kick back with an ice-cold Mexican Coke.

If you want to chat, feel free to **email me**, or you can see what I'm up to on my **website** here: [castelliniluc.io](https://castelliniluc.io).
